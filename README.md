# Project Title: Breast Cancer Prediction

# Description:

This project investigates the use of correlation analysis for feature selection and machine learning algorithms to predict breast cancer. By identifying the most relevant features from datasets containing patient information, the model aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer risk assessment.

# Key Functionalities:

# Data Collection:
Gather breast cancer datasets from reputable sources (e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository, medical institutions).
The data should include various features potentially related to breast cancer, such as age, family history, cell characteristics, and mammogram findings.

# Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
Address outliers (e.g., clipping, winsorization).
Scale numerical features for consistent analysis and model training.

# Correlation Analysis:
Calculate pairwise correlation coefficients between features to identify highly correlated features.
Remove highly correlated features (e.g., with a threshold coefficient) to reduce redundancy and improve model performance.
# Feature Engineering:
Consider creating additional features that might be predictive based on domain knowledge.
Explore alternative feature selection techniques beyond correlation analysis, such as filter methods (e.g., chi-squared test) or wrapper methods (e.g., recursive feature elimination).

# Model Training:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train various machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression) using the selected features.
Tune hyperparameters for each model through cross-validation to optimize prediction accuracy.

# Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of each model on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve for binary classification (benign/malignant);
Compare the models' performance to identify the most effective model for breast cancer prediction.

# Visualization:
Visually represent the correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.
Consider plotting feature importance scores (if applicable) to see which features contribute most to the model's predictions.
Dependencies:

Python libraries commonly used for data science and machine learning (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, seaborn).

# Configure Data Source:
Modify the script to access your chosen dataset.
Ensure the script handles data loading and feature extraction based on the dataset format.

# Run the Script:
Execute the main script (e.g., main.py) to perform data preprocessing, correlation analysis, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and potentially save the trained model for future use.
